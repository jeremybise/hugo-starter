# Hugo Starter

Just the stuff I like all put together in a starter.

## Features

- Barebones theme with SCSS pipelines
- Google fonts via config.toml (via webfont loader)
- Base template with Google Analytics, OpenGraph and Twitter cards

## Todo

- [ ] Netlify CMS?
- [ ] Set up some image processing stuff out the gate?
- [x] Webfont config/loader
- [x] vars.scss loaded up
- [x] normalize.css loaded up
