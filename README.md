# Hugo Starter

Just the stuff I like all put together in a starter.

## Features

- Barebones theme with normalize.css and SCSS pipelines
- Google fonts via config.toml (via webfont loader)
- SCSS vars loaded up with Tailwinds CSS colors, shadows, leading and text sizes for quick playing around
- Base template with Google Analytics, OpenGraph and Twitter cards set up and ready to configure via config.toml

## Todo

- [ ] Netlify CMS?
- [x] Webfont config/loader
- [x] vars.scss
- [x] normalize.css
